## Introduction 
    Rotten Tomatoes is a website for movie and TV show reviews.
## Page to be scrapped 
     In this project we don't scrape the whole website, we just scrape one page that contains 140 action movies which are highly recommended by the website.

## Scraped Data for Each Movie
    Each movie has the following data:
        1. Title (movie name)
        2. Year (year at which the movie was released)
        3. Score (score of the movie)
        4. Adjusted score (not displayed on the website)
        5. Consensus
        6. Synopsis
        7. Director Name
        8. Cast Names
     Each of these data was scraped Separately, and then all of them were combined in a data frame that was extracted as a CSV file.
